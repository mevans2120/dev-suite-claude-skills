2. Design Suite: Create designs, prototypes, specifications
3. Development Suite: Architect, implement, test
4. Design Suite: QA design implementation
5. Development Suite: QA functionality
6. Project Suite: Coordinate launch, track results
```

### New Product (All Three Suites)
```
1. Development Suite: Market research (product-research)
2. Project Suite: Define project plan (project-planner)
3. Design Suite: User research, concepts (design-research, design-concepts)
4. Development Suite: Technical architecture (technical-architecture)
5. Design Suite: Design system, production designs (design-production)
6. Development Suite: Implementation (software-development)
7. Development Suite: Testing (quality-engineering)
8. Design Suite: Accessibility review (design-qa)
9. Project Suite: Launch coordination (project-manager)
```

### Quick Feature (Development Only)
```
1. Development Suite: Architecture (technical-architecture)
2. Development Suite: Implementation (software-development)
3. Development Suite: Testing (quality-engineering)
```

## Installation

**Install all three suites globally:**

```bash
# Clone repositories
git clone https://github.com/mevans2120/design-suite-claude-skills.git
git clone https://github.com/mevans2120/project-suite-claude-skills.git
git clone https://github.com/mevans2120/dev-suite-claude-skills.git

# Create skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# Install Design Suite
cd design-suite-claude-skills
for skill in design-*; do
  ln -s "$(pwd)/$skill" ~/.claude/skills/$skill
done
cd ..

# Install Project Suite
cd project-suite-claude-skills
for skill in project-*; do
  ln -s "$(pwd)/$skill" ~/.claude/skills/$skill
done
cd ..

# Install Development Suite
cd dev-suite-claude-skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/product-research" ~/.claude/skills/product-research
ln -s "$(pwd)/technical-architecture" ~/.claude/skills/technical-architecture
ln -s "$(pwd)/software-development" ~/.claude/skills/software-development
ln -s "$(pwd)/quality-engineering" ~/.claude/skills/quality-engineering
cd ..

# Verify
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/
# Should show 11 symlinked skills
```

## Example Prompts Using Multiple Suites

### Design + Development
```
"Design and implement a user dashboard with analytics"
â†’ design-concepts, design-production, technical-architecture, software-development
```

### Project + Development
```
"Plan and build the authentication system"
â†’ project-planner, technical-architecture, software-development, quality-engineering
```

### All Three Suites
```
"Build a complete task management feature from planning through launch"
â†’ project-planner, design-research, design-concepts, design-production,
  technical-architecture, software-development, quality-engineering,
  design-qa, project-manager
```

## Benefits

**When using single suite:**
- Expert knowledge in that domain
- Focused, specialized assistance
- Quick for specific tasks

**When using multiple suites:**
- âœ… Complete workflow coverage
- âœ… Automatic coordination between phases
- âœ… Consistent approach across disciplines
- âœ… No context loss between handoffs
- âœ… Better final outcomes

**When using all three:**
- ðŸš€ Complete product development lifecycle
- ðŸš€ Professional-grade outputs
- ðŸš€ Nothing falls through the cracks
- ðŸš€ Like having a full product team

## Ecosystem Philosophy

**Modularity:**
- Each suite works independently
- Install only what you need
- Start with one, add others later

**Integration:**
- Suites designed to work together
- Smooth handoffs between phases
- Shared terminology and patterns

**Completeness:**
- Together, cover entire product lifecycle
- From idea to launch to iteration
- Design + Development + Management

## Maintenance

All three suites:
- Follow same structure (SKILL.md format)
- Use same validation approach
- Maintained in separate repositories
- Can be updated independently
- Same installation patterns

**Update workflow:**
```bash
# Update all three
cd design-suite-claude-skills && git pull && cd ..
cd project-suite-claude-skills && git pull && cd ..
cd dev-suite-claude-skills && git pull && cd ..

# Skills auto-update (symlinks)
# Just restart Claude to pick up changes
```
