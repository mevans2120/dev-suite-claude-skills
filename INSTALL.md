zip -r dev-suite-skills.zip . \
  -x "*.git*" \
  -x ".claude-memory/session/*" \
  -x "node_modules/*" \
  -x ".DS_Store"

# The ZIP will be created in the current directory
ls -lh dev-suite-skills.zip
```

**Step 4: Upload to Claude.ai**

1. Open [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in your browser (or open the desktop app)
2. Look for the **Skills** icon in the left sidebar (looks like a puzzle piece üß©)
3. Click **"Upload Skill"** or **"Add Skill"**
4. Browse and select `dev-suite-skills.zip`
5. Wait for the upload to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)
6. You'll see a confirmation when it's done

**Step 5: Test it works!**

- Type: **"Research the market for task management apps"**
- Claude should automatically use the Product Research skill
- You'll see detailed market analysis in the response

**‚úÖ Done!** The skills are now available in all your Claude.ai conversations.

## Option 2: Claude Code CLI

**Perfect for:** Developers using Claude via command-line interface

### Choose Your Scope

| Scope | When to Use | Command |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Global** ‚úÖ | Want skills in ALL projects (recommended) | [Method A](#method-a-global-installation-recommended) |
| **Project** | Want skills in ONE specific project only | [Method B](#method-b-project-specific) |

### Method A: Global Installation (Recommended)

**Makes skills available in all your projects**

**Step 1: Download and validate**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mevans2120/dev-suite-claude-skills.git
cd dev-suite-claude-skills

# Validate
chmod +x scripts/validate-skills.sh
./scripts/validate-skills.sh
# Should show: ‚úÖ All 49 checks passed!
```

**Step 2: Create skills directory**
```bash
# Create the global skills directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
```

**Step 3: Install with symlinks (keeps skills auto-updated)**
```bash
# Get the full path to your cloned repository
REPO_PATH="$(pwd)"

# Create symlinks (this way updates to the repo automatically sync)
ln -s "$REPO_PATH/product-research" ~/.claude/skills/product-research
ln -s "$REPO_PATH/technical-architecture" ~/.claude/skills/technical-architecture
ln -s "$REPO_PATH/software-development" ~/.claude/skills/software-development
ln -s "$REPO_PATH/quality-engineering" ~/.claude/skills/quality-engineering
```

**Step 4: Verify installation**
```bash
# Check that all 4 skills are linked
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/ | grep -E "product-research|technical-architecture|software-development|quality-engineering"

# You should see 4 symlinks (arrows ‚Üí) pointing to your repo
```

**Step 5: Test it works!**
```bash
# Start Claude Code in any project
cd ~/your-project
claude

# Then type: "Design architecture for a blog platform"
# Claude should load the Technical Architecture skill
```

**‚úÖ Done!** Skills are now available globally across all your projects.

**Benefits of symlinks:**
- ‚úÖ Updates to the repo automatically available
- ‚úÖ No file duplication
- ‚úÖ Easy to manage (one copy, many uses)

---

### Method B: Project-Specific

**Makes skills available in ONE project only**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd ~/your-project

# 2. Create project skills directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# 3. Copy skill directories (not symlink, since project-specific)
cp -r /path/to/dev-suite-claude-skills/product-research .claude/skills/
cp -r /path/to/dev-suite-claude-skills/technical-architecture .claude/skills/
cp -r /path/to/dev-suite-claude-skills/software-development .claude/skills/
cp -r /path/to/dev-suite-claude-skills/quality-engineering .claude/skills/

# 4. Verify
ls -la .claude/skills/
# Should see 4 directories
```

**When to use this:**
- Testing skills before global installation
- Project has unique skill requirements
- Don't want skills in other projects

### Option 3: API Usage

If using Claude via API, skills must be uploaded to your account via Claude.ai first (see Option 1), then they'll automatically be available in API calls.

## Validation

Run the validation script to ensure proper installation:

```bash
cd /path/to/dev-suite-claude-skills
./scripts/validate-skills.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
========================================
Validation Summary
========================================
Total checks:   49
Passed:         49
Failed:         0
Warnings:       0

‚úÖ All critical validations passed!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Skills Not Loading

**Problem:** You ask Claude something but the skills don't seem to activate

**How to tell:** The response is generic, doesn't mention using a specific skill

**Example:**
```
You: "Research the task management market"
Claude: [gives brief generic answer without deep market analysis]
‚ùå Product Research skill didn't load
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Verify installation:**
```bash
# For Claude.ai: Check the Skills panel shows your skills

# For Claude Code CLI (Global):
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/ | grep dev-suite

# For Claude Code CLI (Project):
ls -la .claude/skills/

# You should see the 4 skill directories
```

**2. Check the skills are valid:**
```bash
cd /path/to/dev-suite-claude-skills
./scripts/validate-skills.sh

# Should show: ‚úÖ All 49 checks passed
```

**3. Try being more explicit:**
```
Instead of: "Research task management"
Try: "Using the product-research skill, conduct comprehensive market research on task management apps including competitive analysis"
```

**4. Restart Claude (CLI users):**
```bash
# Exit current session
exit

# Start fresh
claude
```

**5. Check frontmatter has trigger keywords:**
```bash
head -5 product-research/SKILL.md

# Should show:
# ---
# name: product-research
# description: Conduct comprehensive product research including...
# ---
```

---

### Issue 2: "Permission Denied" When Running Scripts

**Problem:** Can't execute `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`

**Error message:**
```
-bash: ./scripts/validate-skills.sh: Permission denied
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/validate-skills.sh

# Now run it
./scripts/validate-skills.sh
```

---

### Issue 3: Symlinks Not Working (Windows)

**Problem:** Symlinks fail on Windows

**Error message:**
```
ln: failed to create symbolic link: Operation not supported
```

**Solution:** Use copying instead of symlinking
```bash
# Instead of ln -s, use cp -r
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r product-research ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r technical-architecture ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r software-development ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r quality-engineering ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Note:** With copying, you'll need to manually update if you pull changes from the repo.

---

### Issue 4: ZIP Upload Fails

**Problem:** ZIP file won't upload to Claude.ai

**Possible causes:**
1. File too large
2. Includes unnecessary files

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create a clean ZIP excluding large/unnecessary files
zip -r dev-suite-skills.zip . \
  -x "*.git*" \
  -x ".claude-memory/session/*" \
  -x "node_modules/*" \
  -x ".DS_Store" \
  -x "*.log"

# Check the size
ls -lh dev-suite-skills.zip
# Should be under 5MB
```

---

### Issue 5: Skills Activate But Responses Seem Wrong

**Problem:** Skills load but outputs don't match documentation

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check which version you have
git log --oneline -1

# Update to latest
git pull origin main

# Validate
./scripts/validate-skills.sh
```

**For Claude.ai users:** Re-create and re-upload the ZIP after updating

**For CLI users with symlinks:** Skills auto-update, just restart Claude

---

### Issue 6: Can't Find Skills Directory

**Problem:** `~/.claude/skills/` doesn't exist

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create it
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# Verify
ls -la ~/.claude/skills

# Should show an empty directory ready for skills
```

---

### Issue 7: Multiple Skills Seem to Conflict

**Problem:** Claude uses multiple skills at once causing confusion

**This is normal!** Skills augment Claude's knowledge - they don't replace it. Claude can use multiple skills together when appropriate.

**Example (intended behavior):**
```
You: "Build a task app from scratch"
Claude: [Uses Research + Architecture + Development + QE skills together]
‚úÖ This is correct - comprehensive workflow
```

**If you want only one skill:**
```
You: "Using ONLY the technical-architecture skill, design..."
```

---

### Still Having Issues?

1. **Check GitHub Issues:** https://github.com/mevans2120/dev-suite-claude-skills/issues
2. **Run full diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   # Validate skills
   ./scripts/validate-skills.sh

   # Check installation
   ls -la ~/.claude/skills/

   # Check versions
   git log --oneline -5
   ```
3. **Open a new issue** with:
   - Your installation method (Claude.ai, CLI, etc.)
   - Error messages (full text)
   - Output of `./scripts/validate-skills.sh`
   - Steps you've already tried

### File Permission Errors

**Symptom:** Permission denied when running scripts

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/validate-skills.sh
```

### Skills Conflict

**Symptom:** Multiple skills seem to activate at once causing confusion

**Note:** This is normal behavior. Skills augment Claude's knowledge, they don't replace it. Claude can use multiple skills together when appropriate.

**Best practice:** Be specific in prompts about what you want.

### YAML Parsing Errors

**Symptom:** Errors mentioning frontmatter or YAML

**Solution:**
1. Check YAML syntax in SKILL.md files:
   ```bash
   head -10 product-research/SKILL.md
   ```

2. Ensure proper format:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: Description text
   ---
   ```

3. Validate with script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-skills.sh
   ```

## Updating Skills

### Update Individual Skill

1. Edit the SKILL.md file
2. Update version number in frontmatter
3. Run validation:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-skills.sh
   ```
4. For Claude.ai: Re-upload the updated ZIP
5. For CLI: Changes take effect immediately

### Update All Skills

```bash
# Pull latest changes (if using git)
git pull origin main

# Validate
./scripts/validate-skills.sh

# For Claude.ai: Re-create ZIP and re-upload
zip -r dev-suite-skills.zip . -x "*.git*" -x ".claude-memory/*"
