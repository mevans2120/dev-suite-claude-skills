## What are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows. When you install this skill suite, Claude automatically loads the relevant skill based on your request. For example, asking for "market research" loads the Research skill, while "implement a feature" loads the Development skill.

**Think of skills as expert consultants** - each one brings deep expertise in a specific area of product development.

## Overview

This skill suite provides four specialized skills that work together to enable high-quality digital product development:

1. **Product Research** - Market analysis, competitive research, and technology evaluation
2. **Technical Architecture** - System design, architecture decisions, and technology stack recommendations
3. **Software Development** - Implementation with best practices for React/TypeScript/Next.js and Python
4. **Quality Engineering** - Comprehensive testing strategy and implementation

**Perfect for:** Solo developers, small teams, startups, and anyone building digital products with AI assistance.
