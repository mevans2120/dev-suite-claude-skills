3. "Review test coverage" (QE)
```

### Workflow 2: Code Review
```
1. "Review this architecture: [paste]" (Planning)
2. "Review this code: [paste]" (Development)
3. "What tests are missing?" (QE)
```

### Workflow 3: Technology Decision
```
1. "Research options for [use case]" (Research)
2. "Compare [tech A] vs [tech B]" (Planning)
3. "Recommend best option" (Planning)
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
❌ "Build an app"
✅ "Build a task management app with real-time collaboration for remote teams"

### 2. Mention Constraints
✅ "Design a system that can scale to 100K users"
✅ "Use serverless architecture"
✅ "Budget-conscious solution"

### 3. Request Multiple Skills
✅ "Research, design, and implement user authentication"
✅ "Build this feature with full test coverage"

### 4. Iterate
✅ "That looks good, now optimize for mobile"
✅ "Add error handling"
✅ "Improve the test coverage"

### 5. Ask for Clarification
Claude will ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear. This ensures better results!
